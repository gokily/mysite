		<p>I was born in Paris, France and grew up in Hong-Kong, Tokyo and Paris.
			After finishing high school I studied for two years to pass the entry exam of
			<a href="http://www.ens-lyon.fr/" class="about-external-link">
				ENS de Lyon (France)</a>
			in Biology. After beeing admitted I mainly focus on the study of Genetics and Ecology.
			I went on to get a Ph.D. in Population Genetics from the
			<a href="https://www.mnhn.fr/en" class="about-external-link">National Museum of Natural History (France)</a>
			where I studied the
			<a href="https://www.theses.fr/2017MNHN0007" class="about-external-link">
				influence of kinship systems on genetic diversity in human populations</a>.
		</p>
		<p>
			After my Ph.D., I took a break to visit the Japanese backcountry,
			taking this opportunity to learn more about organic farming and agriculture in general.
			During this time, I also started teaching myself programming following tutorials like
			<a href="https://www.railstutorial.org/" class="about-external-link">
				Rails tutorial
			</a>
			from Michael Hartl and
			<a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/" class="about-external-link">the Odin Project</a>.

			Returning to Paris, I spend the 2018 summer passing the entry exam to 
			<a class="about-external-link" href="https://www.42.fr/">42</a>,
			a programming school based in Paris.
			I started my first year at 
			<a class="about-external-link" href="https://www.42.fr/">42</a>
			in November 2018.
		</p>

			I am also an avid rock climber spending the majority of my free time climbing
			either indoor or outdoor. Every year I take time to travel to climbing spot
			during spring and summer. This passion has translated into my first web app,
			built in Rails: TBA.
