	This is the third post I am making on the Corewar project I recently finished at school. You can read the <a href="{% post_url 2019-09-15-project-corewar-part1:-introduction %}"
	 class="inner-link">first introductory post</a> and <a href="{% post_url 2019-09-28-project-corewar-part2:-team-project %}" class="inner-link">second post about preparation</a>.

<p>
	Before enrolling in 42, I learn some web development using Ruby on Rails.
	During that time, I learnt about test driven development and tried to apply 
	it. That practice disappeared completely after entering in school as it was 
	not as simple as in Ruby to implement test driven development in C.
</p>
<p>
	The project Corewar made me truly realize the importance of testing.
	<!--more-->This project asked us to make two programs. The first, the 
	assembler, was quite easy to test. A correct assembler was available in the
	ressources given with the project. So we could give the same file to our 
	assembler and the correct one and see if the outputed file was the same.
	However, for the virtual machine part, testing was harder. A correct 
	virtual machine was also provided as a ressource. In the most basic state, 
	the virtual machine give as an output the name of the winner. Thus, we 
	could have the same output (the same winner) with an incorrect 
	implementation. So how could we test the virtual machine?
</p>
<p>
	One of the mandatory command line option we had to implement was 
	the -d dump option. This option takes a numerical argument N and makes the 
	program dump the arena state after N cycles. This option is one	of the way 
	to check that the program is correctly updating the arena state	during the 
	game. Whoever the output of this option: the arena state in hexadecimal, 
	was hard to read. Additionally, as it was a snapshot taken at a 
	specific time, it was hard to know which part of the code was causing
	unexpected behaviours. So we could see that our virtual machine was 
	diverging from the correct one at some point, but it was hard to know why.
</p>
<p>
	As a way to debug our program and also as a bonus for the project, we
	started developing as visual mode where we could follow the arena state in 
	‘real time’. This way, we could see when our program was starting to have a 
	different behaviour from what was expected. The visual mode helped us
	debugging our program, however some of the bugs were hard to understand or 
	only appeared in particular situations when	the arena state was already too 
	hard to analyze by human eyes.
</p>
<p>
	So as another bonus for the project, we decided to develop a test suite for 
	the project. The test suite had for the	virtual machine part, two main 
	tests. The first one tested each instruction individually to verify that 
	their behaviour	were correctly implemented. We can assimilate this part as 
	the unit test part of the test suite. The second part was an integration 
	test where we periodically ask the program to dump the arena state with the 
	-d option and check if we get the same arena state as the correct virtual 
	machine. This test checked that the layers we put on top of the 
	instructions were correctly implemented. With these two tests, we covered 
	the entirety of the program, ensuring that it had no more unexpected 
	behaviours.
</p>
<p>
	At the time, I was only considering this test suite as a bonus and as a way 
	to make the debugging easier. In fact, I realized the importance of a good 
	test suite one week after finishing the project. It was when I evaluated 
	the Corewar project of another group. Evaluating this project is hard as 
	the -d dump command line option is almost the only thing you can use to 
	really test the behaviour of the virtual machine. Additionally, as I have 
	already said, reading output from this option is also hard. So, what I did 
	to evaluate their project was to run the test suite that we made to check 
	our program. The integration test went well, no difference could be 
	detected. However, one of the unit tests came back with an error message. 
	One of the instruction was not implemented correctly. You could think that 
	it is strange that the integration test could be correct when one of the 
	fundamental part of the codebase is wrong. However, the incorrectly 
	implemented instruction was so obscure that none of the battling programs 
	used in the integration test were using it. If one of them had this 
	instruction in its code, the integration test would also come back with an 
	error. Talking to the group, they told me that they only tested their 
	virtual machine using the -d option with provided battling programs. Thus, 
	instructions that were not used by any of the battling programs were not 
	tested. It was at that moment that I think I grasped the power of good test 
	practice while developing a program.
</p>
<p>
	Reading the above paragraph, I can feel that it seems to be a insignificant
	event that triggered my realization of the importance of good testing 
	practice. 
	Sometimes the smallest of thing can have a big impact. For me, this was
	such a moment.
